        Influences in my life / moments that have had a profound impact on the way I think

1. (1997) Ishita Di - until I met her I was only making a mental note of people who I didn’t want to be like. She was the first person I felt I wanted to be like. She inspired my character - strength and courage to live on your own terms. Inspired the crux of my character - non conformity (society is just meh)
2. (1999) Going to London and yet missing Kolkata - realised that I don’t like fanciful things if they come at the cost of family friends or anyone that makes my life (Jayshree friends at that time) 
3. (1997) Death of princess diana - she deleted any physical boundaries between a royal and the poorest of the poor. They way she touched and hugged and smiled with the poor made me realise that any differences amongst people are stupid. Even today the single most thing that bothers me the most is any form of disparity. Everyone deserves the same platform. If I ever join politics, this will be my agenda
4. (2005) Ayn rand - Howard roark. no nonsense and raw. Integrity. Authenticity 
5. (2020) death of Sushant Singh Rajput - going through all of his interviews inspired me to be knowledgeable; reintroduced me to the world of books. It coincides with my ongoing education, but got me into multidisciplinary topics - quantum physics, neuroscience, conscience, strong theory, simulation theory, cosmos book by Carl Sagan.


“Make your life the story you want to tell yourself”
1. Do something radical to eliminate disparity among people based on richness/race/color. Equal opportunity and equal treatment. Like the hidden world in atlas shrugged.
2. Eliminate the concept and conditioning of beauty. It can not be a word used to describe people or animals or birds. Beauty or any notion of beauty should not exist in any form. People can be same or different. They can not be beautiful or ugly. Beauty itself is an ugly concept. I wish I didn’t have to teach my daughter the meaning of ugly. 
3. Eliminate religion
4. Make AI software that encourages humans to be more kind 
5.
